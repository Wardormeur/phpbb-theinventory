Extension to enable the creation of products, through service theInventory.net

Extension (may?) be used thourh Lorenzo/nickvergessen gallery to stock image locally ?

Extnesion should allow to specify the installation type : master-dependent (lite) or slave instance (local) + report to master.

Extension allows a post to contains the full-spec of the product, OR to link to a product (overview on link over through ajax?)


v0.1 will contains only basic infos.

v0.2 with slave instance allows caracteristics

v0.3 with slave instance allows usage of plugin

Licence should be defined but the idea as it's a relatively service dependant app, try to stay focused on this ext instead of forking it all along :)
slave code will be open source, master one won't be in the first time
